5. Use the settings dialog (from the menubar) to set save your broadcast folder, this will find the focused rider JSON file which the live data feed comes from. You can also set your preferred view and your zones which automatically generates 'red zones' based on % FTP and % MaxHR for the mini graphs and zone-based power on the combined graph.

> ⚠️ **Note:** TP LiveView is built without an official Apple Developer (I am a casual developer and cannot justify paying them annually to distribute my apps), so macOS cannot verify it. The first time you open it, you may see a warning:  
> “Apple cannot verify TP LiveView is free of malware.”  
>
> To bypass this:  
> - Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → General**  
> - Click **Open Anyway** for TP LiveView.  
> - Subsequent launches will open normally.
