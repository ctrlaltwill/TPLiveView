## Installation

### From GitHub Zip

> ⚠️ **Note:** TP LiveView is built without an official Apple Developer (I am a casual developer and cannot justify paying them annually to distribute my apps), so macOS cannot verify it. The first time you open it, you may see a warning:  
> “Apple cannot verify TP LiveView is free of malware.”  
>
> To bypass this:  
> - Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security → General**  
> - Click **Open Anyway** for TP LiveView.  
> - Subsequent launches will open normally.
